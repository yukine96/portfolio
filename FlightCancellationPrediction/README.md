# Flight Cancellation Prediction

### Executive Summary
This project was completed in December 2021 as a final project for Predictive Analytics course at the University of Edinburgh (Mark = 78/100 (A)). A sample of 1,936,758 records of the United States flight data in 2008 was observed to develop a predictive model on a flight cancellation problem. Several classification algorithms were applied to examine the best and most realistic model to predict a flight cancellation problem with severe class imbalance, including Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ada Boosting, and Gradient Boosting. Models were evaluated primarily using ROC-AUC and accuracy rate. The results suggested Gradient Boosting showed the highest AUC score (0.76) and the highest accuracy at 75.52%. Therefore, we can conclude that Gradient Boosting is the best classification algorithm to predict this particular problem. The result of this study enables airport operators and airline companies to mitigate the occurrences of cancellations as soon as possible, hence minimizing the potential damages, both on the service providers and the passengers.
