# App Review Classification

### Executive Summary
This project was completed in April 2022 as a final project at the University of Edinburgh. App reviews are rich textual information that can be useful for various stakeholders in a company. However, given the large amount of data, it is extremely challenging to identify the most common user concerns that the company should prioritize. Therefore, this study aims at classifying customer reviews based on topics and sentiment to support the decision-making process of stakeholders in six online retailing companies, including Amazon, Tesco, Argos, Booth, Morrisons, and M&S. The results showed that each company have unique issues and therefore app reviews should be analyzed separately. As seen in Figure 1, a majority of negative reviews were talking about bug issues. Thus, companies can prioritize to fix the existing bugs to improve app ratings in Google Play Store. Other popular topics are delivery issues, payment issues, order issues, customer service issues, and login and password issues. There are also some unique topics that only appear in specific apps. For instance, 5.66% of Tesco negative reviews are complaints about difficulty in finding items on the app, 13.16% of Boots negative reviews are complaints on Boots Advantage Card, and 66.41% of Argos reviews indicate that customers are unable to add items to the basket.
